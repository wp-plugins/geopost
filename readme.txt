Uses Google Maps API to create a map containing markers for posts based on individually assigned geocoded locations.

== Description ==

Geopost is a Wordpress plugin based on Google Maps that let's you specify a location for each post and generate an embedded map containing a marker for each post that has been assigned a location. Clicking on these markers will link you to the corresponding post. The map can be inserted into any post or page using the shortcode [geopost]. To set the location for a post, enter a search string in the Geopost metabox in the post's admin page and press 'Search'. If a location is recognized, a map will appear for you to confirm the result. Clicking on the marker icon in the editor window map rotates through different color icons.
